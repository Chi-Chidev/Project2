            <p class="text-sec2">My name is Esther Chinonye. I'm a product designer with aspirations to become
                a full-stack developer. My journey into the tech world began in 2022, and it's
                been a rollercoaster ride challenging yet incredibly rewarding.

                I consider myself to be a blend of introvert and extrovert, depending on my
                environment and the people around me. In the right setting, I can be very
                outgoing and sociable, while other times, I enjoy quiet moments ofreflection
                and solitude.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sec2">
                There's so much more to me than what you'll read here, so I encourage you to
                get to know me personally. In the meantime, here's a sneak peek into my world.

                <p class="sub-t">Games</p>I find my fun and active side when I'm playing
                games. And no, I don't mean football! Here are some of

                indoors watching a movie with some snacks. Recently,
                I've been enjoying reality shows more than dramas. Got
                any good ones to recommend? By the way, I'm not a big
                fan of action movies. I just find them overrated. Please
                don't hold it against me!

                Now, let me give you some insight into the kinds of foods I enjoy and crave daily. I might
                be a picky eater, but I certainly appreciate a good plate of food.
                Before I share my food menu, have you ever noticed that Nigerian cuisine, while delicious,doesn't offer
                a vast variety. As someone who enjoys snacking more than full meals, I don't
                mind the limited options. So, if you're curious to see my favorite meals, just click on<br><a
